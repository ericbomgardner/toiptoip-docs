## Overview

Dot Puz is a crossword puzzle app for iOS designed to work locally on your device with minimal data sent externally.

## Data Collection

Dot Puz does **not** collect, store, or share any personal information. There are no user accounts, no analytics, no advertising, and no third-party tracking.

## Explain Answer Feature

Dot Puz includes an optional feature that explains why a crossword answer fits its clue. When you use this feature, puzzle clue(s) and answer(s) are sent to a server operated by the developer, which forwards the request to Anthropic's API to generate an explanation. No personally identifying information is included in these requests. Anthropic's use of data is governed by [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy).

## iCloud Sync

If you have iCloud enabled on your device, Dot Puz may sync your puzzle files and progress across your devices using Apple's iCloud service. This data is managed entirely by Apple and subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/). You can disable iCloud sync in your device settings.

## Third-Party Services

Dot Puz uses only the following third-party services:

- **Anthropic API** — for the optional Explain Answer feature
- **Apple iCloud** — for optional cross-device sync

No other third-party services, SDKs, or trackers are used.
