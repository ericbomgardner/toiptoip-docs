## Getting Started

ÉTUI plays .puz format crossword puzzles. To get started, open a .puz file from Safari, Files, or another app, and it will open in ÉTUI.

## Common Questions

**Where can I find puzzles?**
Many crossword publishers offer free or paid puzzles in .puz format. Check [Crossword Fiend](https://crosswordfiend.com/download/) for links to downloadable puzzles -- I personally subscribe to the NYT and Fireball puzzles.

**How does iCloud sync work?**
If iCloud is enabled on your device, your puzzles and progress sync automatically across your devices. You can disable this in Settings > [your name] > iCloud.

**What does "Explain Answer" do?**
After completing a puzzle, you can tap a clue to get a brief explanation of why the answer fits. This sends the clue and answer to an AI service to generate the explanation.
